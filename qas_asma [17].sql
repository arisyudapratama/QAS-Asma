(1, 'Asma kambuh dikasih resep obat macamnya 4 Tapi yang saya minum 2 macam saja yaitu ambroxol dan teosal apakah bahaya?', 'Teosal mengandung zat aktif teofilin dan salbutamol. Keduanya merupakan jenis obat bronkodilator, yaitu bekerja untuk melebarkan saluran napas dengan cara melemaskan otot pernapasan sehingga diharapkan keluhan sesak berkurang. Sedangkan ambroxol merupakan jenis mukolitik, yaitu berfungsi untuk mengencerkan lendir di saluran napas sehingga lebih mudah dikeluarkan melalui mekanisme batuk. Keduanya memiliki cara kerja yang berbeda dan seringkali dikombinasikan pada beberapa kondisi misalnya pada kasus asma. Anda dapat mengonsumsi keduanya dalam waktu yang bersamaan jika memang sebelumnya telah diresepkan, namun sebaiknya dalam jangka waktu tertentu yang telah direkomendasikan oleh dokter yang menangani sesuai dengan kondisi medis anda agar tidak terjadi efek samping yang tidak diinginkan. Jika sudah diresepkan beberapa jenis obat, sebaiknya baca kembali petunjuk pemakaiannya di label obat. Beberapa jenis obat memang tidak untuk dikonsumsi sampai habis, yakni hanya jika ada gejala saja, sementara yang lainnya perlu dikonsumsi hingga jangka waktu tertentu.     '),

Hipertensi terjadi ketika tekanan darah sistolik melebihi 130 mmHg atau tekanan darah diastolik melebihi 90 mmHg pada saat dilakukan pengukuran pada kondisi individu tenang, tidak setelah aktifitas fisik yang memacu kerja jantung.\r\n\r\nHipertensi dapat dibagi menjadi hipertensi primer, dimana hipertensi terjadi tanpa sebab yang jelas atau hipertensi sekunder, dimana hipertensi terjadi dengan adanya penyakit yang mendasari / menyebabkan peningkatan tekanan darah seperti gangguan ginjal, kelainan kelenjar tiroid, kondisi kehamilan, gangguan pembuluh darah, hiperkolesterolemia, efek samping obat-obatan.\r\n\r\nPada pengobatan hipertensi dapat menggunakan obat melalui konsumsi oral (obat minum) ataupun obat secara intravena (melalui infus, dapat digunakan pada kondisi hipertensi emergensi, pasien tidak sadarkan diri, atau dalam perawatan di Rumah Sakit). Ada berbagai jenis golongan anti hipertensi yang dapat dipilih sebagai modalitas pengobatan seperti ACE inhibitor, Calcium Channel Blockers, Diuretics, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, Beta-blockers. Pada kondisi hipertensi yang dialami dengan penyakit komorbid asma, disarankan untuk menggunakan pengobatan anti hipertensi golongan Calcium Channel Blockers karena memiliki efek menurunkan tekanan darah dan juga efek bronkodilator. Tentunya bila ada kerabat / diri anda memiliki kondisi ini disarankan untuk konsultasi pada dokter atau dokter spesialis penyakit dalam untuk kontrol berkala, dilakukan pemeriksaan dan penatalaksanaan yang tepat untuk kondisi ini.\r\n\r\nPerlu diingat bahwa panel Alodokter digunakan untuk membantu dan memberikan informasi kesehatan bagi masyarakat yang memerlukan.

(3, 'Apakah ada obat asma untuk ibu ibu yang sedang hamil?', 'Kondisi asma merupakan suatu kondisi dimana terjadi penyempitan saluran napas oleh karena reaksi berlebihan dari tubuh terhadap suatu zat. Beberapa pemicu yang mungkin menyebabkan hal ini seperti infeksi, debu, aktivitas, serbuk bunga atau zat lain yang merupakan penyebab alergi terutama jika anda memiliki riwayat alergi. Faktor resiko dari kejadian ini seperti adanya riwayat alergi dalam keluarga atau diri sendiri, riwayat asma pada keluarga. Mengingat kondisi ibu yang sedang hamil memiliki perbedaam penanganan terutama dalam obat karena adanya resiko zat tersebut masuk ke peredaran darah janin, maka konsultasi dengan dokter anda penting. Beberapa jenis obat-obatan yang dapat membantu seperti golongan kortikosteroid inhalan, antihistamin seperti loratadine. Konsultasikan dengan dokter mengenai pemilihan obat dan dosisnya. Jangan menentukan pengobatan sendiri tanpa petunjuk dokter. Berusaha untuk menghindari serangan dengan menghindari pencetus amat penting. Asma pada ibu hamil yang tidak terkontrol dapat menyebabkan preeklampsia, dan gangguan pertumbuhan janin serta berat badan lahir janin yang rendah. Berikut mengenai asma pada ibu hamil'),

Nama obatnya Asetilsistein dan Alegi.', 'Asma dapat kambuh akibat terjadi pajanan terhadap pencetusnya dimana kondisi serangan ini dapat timbul ringan sampai berat. Jika kekambuhan cukup sering maka perlu untuk dilakukan evaluasi baik pengobatan yang diberikan maupun faktor apa yang memicunya agar dapat dihindari dan asma tidak kembali kambuh.\r\n\r\nObat yang digunakan untuk mengelola asma sendiri ada beberapa macam, baik obat yang untuk meredakan ketika serangan sedang timbul maupun obat yang digunakan untuk mengelola agar tidak kembali terjadi serangan. Obat yang diberikan sendiri juga biasanya digunakan untuk mengatasi gejala lain atau gejala yang menjadi pemicu seperti misalnya ketika sedang batuk dan pilek.\r\n\r\nObat yang diberikan untuk Anda adalah acetylcysteine yang merupakan obat antimukolitik yang berfungsi untuk mengencerkan dahak yang mengganggu saluran pernapasan, obat ini memiliki efek samping seperti mual, muntah, sariawan, mengantuk, pilek ataupun demam. Sedangkan obat kedua yaitu obat yang berisi antihistamin dan kotrikosteroid yang berfungsi untuk mengatasi alergi dan juga peradangan dimana pada asma dapat terjadi peradangan dan penyempitan pada saluran pernapasan. Jika timbul gejala seperti yang dirasakan kondisi tersebut dapat mungkin terjadi akibat efek samping obat ataupun kondisi lain yang menjadi penyebabnya seperti misalnya jika terjadi gangguan pencernaan ataupun demam dan infeksi saluran pernapasan.\r\n\r\nUntuk itu perlu diperhatikan jika mengonsumsi obat serupa dan kembali mengalami hal yang sama maka perlu untuk dihindari karena dapat mungkin merupakan efek samping obat. Periksakan kembali kondisi Anda dan terangkan pada dokter mengenai kondisi yang dialami dan obat apa yang dikonsumsi sehingga dapat dipertimbangkan untuk mengganti dengan obat lain yang sesuai dengan kondisi Anda. Jika timbul reaksi alergi yang lebih berat, sesak napas kembali menyerang, dan timbul keluhan lain seperti ruam kulit, bibir, kelopak mata terasa kebas atau membengkak maka segera datang ke fasilitas kesehatan untuk mendapatkan penanganan.

(5, 'Napas terengah dada sakit jari kaki dan tangan sulit digerakkan, dan mata juga sulit terbuka. Napas tidak teratur, saya tidak sadar. Apa itu berbahaya untuk saya?', 'Asma adalah reaksi alergi yang terjadi pada saluran napas. Ditandai dengan sesak napas disertai suara \"ngi\". Terjadi akibat alergen (seperti debu, serbuk bunga, makanan bahan udang dan telur, udara dingin dan lain-lain) menyebabkan saluran napas mengalami konstriksi sehingga menyempit, ditambah lapisan mukosa saluran napas menghasilkan lendir dalam jumlah banyak sehingga menutupi saluran napas yang menyempit. Maka muncullah sesak napas. Pada saat menghembuskan napas, udara keluar diantara saluran napas yang menyempit dan ditutupi lendir, sehingga muncul suara \"ngik\". Hal ini hanya terjadi pada seseorang yang hipersensitif. Terdapat kaitan yang erat dengan faktor keturunan.\r\nSeseorang yang mengalami asma, dapat memiliki reaksi alergi dalam bentuk yang lain, dari yang ringan (seperti bintik kemerahan yang gatal pada kulit akibat berkontak dengan logam jam tangan penyebab reaksi alergi, bersin-bersin pagi hari akibat debu) hingga kondisi yang berat (reaksi anafilaksis dan angioudema) yang ditandai peningkatan denyut nadi, penurunan kesadaran, muka bengkak dan bibir bengkak). Untuk itu, sebaiknya hindarilah kondisi yang dapat memicu reaksi, seperti udara dingin malam hari. Apabila harus mengikuti kegiatan camping, siapkanlah pakaian penghangat lengkap dari kaus kaki hingga topi dan obat-obatan anti alergi. Karena pada penyakit asma pun dapat terjadi serangan asma yang berat, disebut Serangan asmatikus. Dimana dapat hingga menyebabkan penurunan kesadaran dan henti napas sehingga membutuhkan perawatan intensif.\r\nUntuk apa yang telah anda alami. Sebaiknya berkonsultasi dengan dokter paru anda. Agar dokter dapat melakukan pemeriksaan pada paru-paru anda. Agar dokter dapat menilai derajat berat ringannya penyakit asma pada anda. Dan dapat memberikan pengobatan yang sesuai berdasarkan kondisi berat ringannya penyakit anda.\r\nDemikian semoga bermanfaat.    '),
(6, 'Sesak saat saya tarik napas batuk kering dan susah menarik napas, kenapa? Bangun pagi sering bersin tapi sampai telinga saya kadang kayak terasa tertutup seperti kemasukan air, itu kenanapa?', 'Batuk adalah salah satu cara tubuh dalam mencegah atau mengeluarkan “benda asing” atau zat/partikel tertentu ke saluran pernafasan. Batuk yang hanya sekali-sekali masih bisa disebut wajar, namun jika sudah berulang kali, berhari-hari, hingga berdahak, berdarah, sesak nafas, demam, maka batuk tersebut merupakan salah satu tanda dari adanya penyakit tertentu.Batuk dapat disebabkan oleh infeksi (misalnya: infeksi saluran pernafasan atas, pneumonia, TB, dl), asma, bronchitis, konsumsi obat darah tinggi tertentu, dll.\r\n\r\nAsma sendiri merupakan penyakit kronis (jangka panjang) dimana terjadi penyempitan bronchus (saluran/pipa2 pernafasan di paru-paru) karena seseorang tersebut memiliki sistem saluran pernafasan yang lebih “sensitive” terhadap sesuatu. Gejala asma misalnya sesak nafas, nafas berbunyi mengi saat mengeluarkan nafas, dan batuk-batuk. Gejala tersebut muncul secara hilang-timbul, misalnya ketika terpapar hal yang membuat alergi, stress, zat-zat yang membuat iritasi saluran nafas, maka gejala-gejala tersebut dapat muncul. Memiliki keluarga yang memiliki riwayat asma dapat meningkatkan kemungkinan seseorang untuk menderita asma juga.\r\n\r\nBatuk-batuk merupakan salah 1 gejala asma, namun bisa juga karena kondisi penyakit lain seperti yang sudah saya sebutkan di atas. Untuk menentukan penyebabnya, sebaiknya Anda pergi ke dokter untuk dilakukan pemeriksaan fisik dan penunjang yang diperlukan, misalnya tes darah lengkap, foto ronsen, spirometry, dll. Pengobatannya tergantung dari penyebabnya.\r\n\r\nBersin-bersin bisa disebabkan karena rhinitis (radang pada hidung), bisa karena alergi, infeksi, gangguan hormonal, stress, atau vasomotor. Telinga yang terasa penuh bisa disebabkan karena adanya gangguan pada fungsi tuba eustachius (saluran yang menghubungkan antara tenggorokan dengan telinga) karena ada rhinitis, tonsilitis, radang di telinga, dll; atau karena ada penyumbatan di telinga, misalnya karena penumpukan cerumen (kotoran telinga) atau peradangan di telinga luar atau telinga tengah. Untuk menentukan penyebabnya, harus dilakukan pemeriksaan langsung oleh dokter atau dokter spesialis THT.\r\n\r\nJangan tunda untuk ke dokter jika batuk tidak kunjung reda lebih dari 7 hari, batuk terus berulang, batuk disertai dahak, demam, sesak nafas, batuk disertai darah. Jika memiliki alergi, hindari paparan terhadap hal-hal yang dapat mencetuskan alergi tersebut.  '),
(7, 'Pertolongan pertama ketika asma kambuh, bagaimana ya dok?', 'Asma memang merupakan penyakit kronis yang cukup umum terjadi di seluruh penjuru dunia. Gejalanya yang berupa sesak nafas akan terasa sangat menganggu bahkan dapat berbahaya. Oleh karena penyakit ini tidak akan pernah sembuh sempurna (tetap dapat kambuh sewaktu-waktu jika terpapar alergen) maka penting bagi tiap orang untuk mengetahui penanganan pertama ketika terjadi serangan asma. Berikut tips sederhana yang dapat Anda lakukan saat serangan asma kambuh:\r\n\r\nHindari segera segala faktor pencetus asma (debu, asap, serbuk tanaman, dll)\r\nGunakan inhaler yang sebelumnya telah diresepkan oleh dokter. Isap sebanyak 1 atau 2 kali.\r\nTetap tenang dan jangan panik\r\nApabila masih sesak isap kembali inhaler 2 kali tiap 2 menit. Lakukan hal ini hingga 10 kali.\r\nApabila sesak tidak juga berkurang segera ke IGD terdekat guna penanganan lebih lanjut oleh dokter.\r\nPenting bagi setiap penderita asma untuk mengetahui hal-hal yang dapat memicu serangan asma. Kadang selain objek tertentu, kecapekan ketika beraktifitas/berolahraga juga dapat memicu asma. Pemicu-pemicu tersebut harus dihindari agar serangan asma tidak kembali berulang. Untuk selanjutnya konsultasikan kembali ke dokter spesialis paru mengenai langkah pengendalian asma terbaik bagi Anda'),
(8, 'Mengkonsumsi obat ledomer sebanyak 3 biji dan akhirnya saya kejang apa yang harus dilakukan. apakah ada obat yang bisa menyembuhkannya?', 'Lodomer merupakan suatu merk dagang dengan kandungan haloperidol didalamnya, haloperidol sendiri bukanlah obat asma, namun suatu obat yang diindikasikan untuk kondisi medis seperti masalah kesehatan mental dan psikologis ataupun gangguan sistem saraf pusat yang memicu timbulnya gerakan-gerakan tidak wajar dan tidak bisa dikendalikan.\r\n\r\nMaka itu harus dikaji secara lebih seksama, kondisi medis apakah yang sebenarnya Anda alami sehingga perlu mengknsumsi obat tersebut? baik itu kondisi kesehatan mental ataupun sistem saraf pusat. Disisi lain beberapa efek samping haloperidol yang mungkin timbul adalah mulut terasa kering, sakit kepala, sulit buang air kecil, gemetaran, berdebar-debar, berkeringat, otot terasa kaku, dan merasa linglung.\r\n\r\nSedangkan asma adalah suatu kondisi dimana saluran pernafasan mengalami penyempitan sehingga timbulah rasa sulit bernafas atau sesak, pemicu asma setiap individu bisa berbeda-beda, seperti misalnya asap rokok, debu, aktivitas fisik, kelembapan udara dan suhu, atau terapapr suatu zat kimia tertentu. Penanganan asma ditangani dengan obat-obatan pelega serangan asma dan obat untuk mencegah kekambuhan asma. Asma merupakan penyakit jangka panjang yang bisa dikontrol dengan cara menghindari pemicunya dan mengkonsumsi obat untuk mencegah terjadinya serangan asma atau bahkan tubuh mulai toleran/terbiasa sehingga seolah serangan asma tidak muncul kembali sehingga dianggap sembuh, namun tetap saja ada kemungkinan suatu hari nanti serangan asma bisa muncul kembali.\r\n\r\nSaran untuk Anda adalah memeriksakan diri kembali ke dokter secara langsung untuk mengkaji kondisi kesehatan Anda atas penggunaan haloperidol tersebut, sebab obat tersebut termasuk golongan obat keras yang apabila penggunaanya tidak tepat sesuai indikasi ataupun melakukan penyalahgunaan obat dapat menyebabkan berbagai efek yang tidak baik bagi kesehatan.\r\nSemoga bermanfaat.

(9, 'Saya punya penyakit asma, kalau saya stres, atau habis marah, biasanya langsung kambuh. Apakah penyakit asma itu bisa merambat ke jantung?', 'Asma dibedakan menjadi dua yaitu Asma kardial dan Asma bronkial. Asma bronkial merupakan penyakit yang dikarenakan adanya peradangan dan penyempitan saluran pernapasan yang sehingga dapat membuat sesak napas. Selain sesak, asma dapat disertai dengan gejala lain seperti batuk, nyeri dada dan mengi. Sedangkan asma kardial timbul karena adanya kelainan pada jantung (gagal jantung). Jadi gagal jantung yang dapat menimbulkan gejala asma.\r\n\r\nKomplikasi yang dapat timbul karena asma adalah tubuh sering merasa lelah, menurunnya aktifitas, gangguan pertumbuhan pada anak-anak, status asmatikus (kondisi asma parah yang tidak respon dengan terapi pada umumnya), pneumonia, gangguan pernapasan, kerusakan pada sebagian atau seluruh paru-paru dan hingga kematian. '),
(10, 'Bagaimana cara mengatasi penyakit asma pada bayi umur 5 bulan?', 'Asma merupakan penyakit peradangan kronik yang terjadi pada saluran pernafasan sehingga saluran pernafasan menjadi menyempit dan menyebabkan sulit bernafas. Asma ini dapat menyerang anak-anak maupun dewasa. Asma ini biasanya muncul pada orang-orang dengan riwayat keluarga yang menderita asma, memiliki riwayat keluarga dengan penyakit alergi/atopik, atau sedang mengalami infeksi saluran pernafasan. Gejala yang muncul biasanya sesak disertai bunyi mengi, batuk, pilek, demam, dan lain-lain.\r\n\r\nAsma pada anak usia kurang dari 2 tahun umumnya sulit ditegakkan karena biasanya keluhannya mirip dengan penyakit infeksi saluran pernafasan lainnya, salah satu yang tersering pada anak kurang dari 2 tahun adalah bronkiolitis. Oleh karena itu untuk memastikan penyebabnya adalah asma atau bukan sebaiknya konsultasikan ke dokter anak, dokter akan melakukan tanya jawab mengenai keluhan yang timbul dan riwayat kesehatan dalam keluarga, pemeriksaan fisik, dan beberapa pemeriksaan penunjang bila dibutuhkan. Dokter akan memberikan penanganan sesuai dengan penyebab yang mendasari. Bila keluhan disebabkan asma, maka dokter akan memberikan pengobatan sesuai dengan pedoman penanganan asma pada anak. Dokter mungkin akan memberikan obat-obatan minum atau melakukan nebulisasi/pengasapan dengan obat yang mengandung pelega pernafasan bila dibutuhkan. Karena asma ini adalah penyakit yang diturunkan dan dicetuskan oleh sesuatu, maka sebaiknya cari tahu terlebih dahulu faktor yang dapat mencetuskan asma pada anak anda sehingga dapat dihindari dan serangan asma bisa tidak terjadi.\r\nDemikian, semoga bermanfaat.

(11, 'Sering bernapas manual dan dangkal terus kepikiran kalau tidur suka susah karena harus ngatur napas dulu, keesokan harinya seperti itu lagi terus berulang dan bikin mood saya jelek terus kejadiannya sehabis demam, kira-kira apakah saya harus cek kesehatan atau tidak?', 'Sistem pernapasan pada manusia terdiri dari banyak organ mulai dari organ pernapasan serta persarafan yang mengatur pola napas dimana tubuh akan mengirimkan sinyal pada otak untuk menggerakkan sistem pernapasan. Sistem pernapasan sendiri diatur oleh pusat pernapasan yang bertanggung jawab untuk mengontrol pernapasan secara otomatis sehingga kita tidak akan lupa bernapas baik saat beraktivitas ataupun saat tidur. Baik secara sadar atau tidak tetapi kita juga dapat mengatur untuk mengendalikan napas terlebih pada kondisi tertentu seperti misalnya saat berenang, saat berlari dan lainnya.\r\n\r\nJika terdapat gangguan pada saluran pernapasan hal ini yang dapat membuat timbulnya gangguan seperti saluran napas yang tersumbat, hidung mampet, pilek, batuk dan lainnya sehingga merasakan adanya gangguan pada jalan napas. Dalam hal ini banyak yang menjadi penyebabnya mulai dari infeksi saluran napas, flu, batuk pilek ataupun terjadi sesak napas karena kondisi lain seperti misalnya gangguan pada fungsi paru atau penyakit menahun seperti asma.\r\n\r\nUntuk membantu agar dapat lebih nyaman saat tidur dan mengatasi hidung tersumbat dapat dilakukan beberapa upaya diantaranya dengan membuat suhu ruangan tidak terlalu dingin, banyak mengonsumsi cairan terlebih air hangat, mandi air hangat, menghirup uap air hangat, menggunakan bantal yang lebih tinggi saat tidur, menggunakan obat pelega saluran napas baik obat minum, obat hirup ataupun obat tetes jika diperlukan dan periksakan diri pada dokter jika keluhan demam berlanjut ataupun timbul disertai gejala lain seperti sesak napas, bibir kuku tampak kebiruan, demam tinggi, mual dan muntah serta sakit kepala hebat.\r\nSemoga bermanfaat.   '),
(12, 'saya mau bertanya kenapa setiap saya merasa kedinginan atau cuaca dingin saya selalu sesak napas?', 'Pada orang normal, perubahan suhu udara umumnya tidak akan menyebabkan gangguan pernafasan seperti sesak nafas. Bila udara dingin membuat anda menjadi sesak nafas, maka perlu diperiksa kembali apakah anda memiliki penyakit seperti asma, PPOK, atau bronkitis. Pada orang yang memiliki asma, PPOK, ataupun bronkitis, udara dingin bisa menyebabkan saluran nafas menjadi lebih kering dan teriritasi dan juga bisa menyebabkan saluran nafas menjadi lebih menyempit (terkonstriksi) sehingga dapat memicu terjadinya sesak nafas.\r\n\r\nBila sesak nafas tersebut anda rasakan saat anda berada di tempat yang dingin dan tinggi (misalnya di pegunungan), maka masih mungkin sesak yang anda rasakan tersebut masih normal saja. Kandungan oksigen di udara di tempat yang tinggi memang lebih sedikit dibanding di dataran rendah, oleh karena itu kadang di tempat yang tinggi nafas terasa menjadi lebih susah dan sesak.\r\n\r\nBila anda merasakan sesak nafas setiap kali udara menjadi dingin (tidak melihat apakah tempat tersebut termasuk dataran tinggi atau tidak), maka sebaiknya lakukan pemeriksaan ke dokter paru untuk evaluasi lebih lanjut. Dokter dapat melakukan pemeriksaan langsung pada paru anda atau bisa menyaranakan anda untuk melakukan rontgen ataupun tes fungsi paru untuk melihat apakah terdapat penyakit tertentu pada paru anda.\r\n\r\nBeberapa hal yang bisa anda lakukan untuk mengurangi kemungkinan terjadinya sesak nafas di udara dingin:\r\n\r\ngunakan pakaian yang tebal dan berlapis\r\nbalut longgar syal/scarf di sekitar hidung dan mulut anda agar anda bisa bernafas dengan udara yang lebih hangat dan lembab\r\nbila anda banyak berada di ruang ber-AC, cobalah lebih sering membersihkan AC anda dan juga gunakan pelembab udara atau humidifier di ruangan tersebut.'),
(13, 'Mengapa saya setiap pagi mengalami sesak batuk pilek tetapi setiap siang maupun sore malam saya sehat saja? Dan pagi itu membuat tidur saya tidak bisa lelap', 'Berkaitan dengan keluhan yang anda sampaikan, penyakit yang dapat terjadi, yaitu :\r\n1. Asma bronkial, yaitu penyakit peradangan pada saluran pernapasan yang disebabkan reaksi alergi. Penyakit ini ditandai dengan sesak napas dengan suara \"ngi\".\r\n2. Rinitis alergi, yaitu peradangan pada lapisan mukosa hidung akibat reaksi alergi. Penyakit ini ditandai dengan bersin-bersin yang terjadi setiap pagi hari.\r\nReaksi alergi yang terjadi pada tubuh anda, merupakan penyakit yang diturunkan secara genetik. Penanganan yang paling utama adalah dengan menghindari pencetusnya. Reaksi alergi yang terjadi pada pagi hari, disebabkan udara dingin dan debu. Sehingga, gunakanlah baju dingin saat anda mulai merasakan udara dingin. Hindari menggunakan AC atau kipas angin pada pagi hari dan saat cuaca dingin. Jaga kebersihan ruangan tidur anda, terutama dari debu. Debu sering dijumpai dan menyebar di udara pada kipas angin. Sehingga, jika menggunakan kipas angin perlu agar anda secara teratur membersihkannya. Anda juga dapat mengatur waktu tidur, dengan tidur lebih awal dan bangun di waktu lebih pagi agar kualitas tidur anda tetap terjaga. Hindarilah batuk atau infeksi saluran napas karena dapat memperberat kondisi.\r\nAnda perlu berkonsultasi dengan dokter paru berkaitan dengan keluhan sesak napas yang dialami. Dokter akan meresepkan obat asma, yaitu obat yang berfungsi melapangkan saluran napas dan mengurangi produksi lendir saluran napas, jika diperlukan. Obat dapat berupa tablet yang diminum atau disemprotkan ke mulut atau dengan diasap (nebulizer).\r\nDemikian semoga bermanfaat. '),
(14, 'Pemijatan area punggung pada penderita asma apakah dapat menyembuhkan?   ', 'Tidak benar bahwa keluhan asma dapat berkurang dengan pemijatan di daerah punggung. Asma merupakan penyempitan di saluran napas bawah akibat inflamasi yang terjadi kronis dan bersifat rekuren dengan mekanisme alergi yang mendasarinya.

(15, 'saya ingin bertanya apakah ada pil kb darutat untuk orang yang memiliki riwayat asma?', 'Kontrasepsi darurat ialah kontrasepsi yang dipakai untuk mencegah kehamilan pascahubungan seksual tanpa pelindung atau tanpa penggunaan kontrasepsi yang tepat dan konsisten sebelumnya. Kontrasepsi darurat memiliki manfaat proteksi yang optimal bila digunakan dalam 5 hari pertama pascasenggama, namun efektivitasnya lebih baik jika digunakan sesegara mungkin setelah hubungan seksual. Efektivitasnya cukup baik karena tingkat kegagalannya (kejadian kehamilan) kurang dari 3%.\r\n\r\nBeberapa indikasi penggunaan kontrasepsi darurat meliputi:\r\n\r\nPemerkosaan\r\nSenggama tanpa kontrasepsi\r\nPenggunaan kontrasepsi yang tidak tepat atau tidak konsisten, contoh: lupa minum pil KB lebih dari 2 tablet, terlambat suntik KB 3 bulanan selama lebih dari 2 minggu, terlambat suntik KB bulanan lebih dari 1 minggu, kondom bocor/lepas/salah pakai, ejakulasi di dalam vagina pada sanggama terputus\r\nTerdapat beberapa jenis pil kontrasepsi dengan beberapa variasi dosis yang dapat digunakan sebagai metode kontrasepsi darurat. Biasanya penggunaannya adalah dalam 3 hari pascasenggama.\r\n\r\nKontrasepsi darurat, sebagaimana metode kontrasepsi pil pada umumnya, aman digunakan oleh pasien dengan riwayat penyakit asma. Penggunaan pil kontrasepsi tidak mempengaruhi kinerja obat asma yang Anda gunakan, begitu pula sebaliknya.\r\n\r\nBila Anda hendak menggunakan kontrasepsi darurat, sangat disarankan untuk berkonsultasi terlebih dahulu dengan dokter atau dokter spesialis kebidanan dan kandungan supaya dapat dilakukan evaluasi terlebih dahulu dan dapat diberikan perencanaan penggunaan kontrasepsi darurat yang tepat.

Pada saat serangan datang, penderita asma bisa menggunakan obat pereda serangan asma, salah satunya dalam bentuk inhaler (obat semprot). Adapun komposisi inhaler asma ini memang bisa bermacam-macam, contohnya berupa bronkodilator, relaksan otot polos, anti radang, dan sebagainya. Pemilihan jenis inhaler ini tentu bisa bisa dilakukan sembarangan, melainkan harus dengan resep dan pengawasan dokter. Dosis dan cara penggunaan inhaler ini pun bisa bervariasi tergantung usia, postur tubuh, keparahan asma Anda, dan beragam faktor lainnya. Selain inhaler, ada beragam jenis sediaan obat lain untuk meredakan serangan asma, contohnya obat minum atau suntik. Tidak hanya itu, setelah serangan asma tertangani, Anda pun perlu mengkonsumsi obat untuk mengontrol asma, agar kekambuhan serangan asma bisa diminimalisasi.\r\n\r\nSebab itu, berkonsultasilah langsung dengan dokter atau dokter spesialis penyakit dalam agar diberikan penanganan yang terbaik sesuai dengan kondisi Anda ya.. Selain menggunakan obat dokter, agar serangan asma tidak selalu kambuh dan berulang, Anda sebaiknya kenali apa saja pencetus serangan asma Anda, dan hindari pencetus tersebut.

Hipertensi paru ini bisa terjadi akibat pengaruh genetik, efek samping obat, gangguan jantung, gangguan jaringan ikat, HIV, gangguan hati, emfisema, gangguan paru, gangguan tidur, emboli paru, kelainan darah, sarkoidosis, gangguan metabolik, atau juga karena penyebab yang tidak diketahui (idiopatik). Jika tidak ditangani dengan baik, hipertensi paru bisa memicu bengkak jantung, gagal jantung, pembekuan darah, gangguan katup jantung, hingga perdarahan yang berujung kematian.\r\n\r\nHipertensi paru bukanlah merupakan kondisi yang bisa disembuhkan. Namun, dokter bisa memberikan Anda penanganan agar gejalanya membaik dan Anda pun bisa kembali beraktifitas tanpa kendala berarti. Penanganan ini bisa dilakukan dengan pemberian beberapa jenis obat, seperti vasodilator, antagonis reseptor endotelin, penghambat saluran kalsium dosis tinggi, antikoagulan, stimulator SGC (soluble guanylate cyclase), diuretik, dan sebagainya. Operasi, seperti septostomi atrium, cangkok paru, hingga cangkok jantung-paru bisa juga dilakukan pada kasus yang tidak merespon baik dengan pengobatan.\r\n\r\nBeberapa pengobatan yang kerap diberikan pada penderita hipertensi paru ada yang bisa memperburuk gejala asma, meningkatkan frekuensi serangannya, ada pula yang tidak.

Kejadian asma dilaporkan berkaitan dengan faktor genetik, lingkungan (termasuk di dalamnya hal-hal yang mencetuskan asma seperti: cuaca dingin, tungau dalam debu, bulu binatang, aktivitas fisik, infeksi virs, dsb). Gejala umumnya batuk, sesak, dan mengi dan bisa juga ditambah gejala lain bergantung pada berat serangan asma. Pada serangan yang berat, anak akan merasa gelisah, lebih baik bila duduk bertopang lengan dan kalimat yang diucapkan terbata-bata (sebatas kata-kata saja). Pemeriksaan penunjang untuk mendukung diagnosis asma salah satunya spirometri. Pengobatan asma itu sendiri ada 2 macam : mengatasi serangan dan mencegah serangan asma berulang. Pengobatan meliputi obat pelebar saluran napas hingga kortikosteroid.\r\n        Di samping asma, ada pula kondisi yang serupa yakni bronkiolitis. Bronkiolitis merupakan peradangan pada bronkiolus (saluran napas yang kecil) akibat infeksi virus. Penyakit ini sering dialami oleh anak di bawah 2 tahun dengan puncaknya pada usia 2-6 bulan. Seperti halnya asma, saluran napas (bronkiolus) juga menyempit akibat respon peradangan. Pada umumnya, 1-4 hari anak mengalami pilek/hidung tersumbat terlebih dahulu, ada demam, lalu barulah diikuti oleh batuk, sesak, mengi, dsb. Pengobatannya bersifat suportif yaitu dengan pemeberian oksigen, cairan agar tidak dehidrasi, sering juga disertai obat pelebar jalan napas seperti asma.\r\n        Bila anak Anda sering mengalami gejala-gejala seperti yang Anda keluhkan, sebaiknya ajaklah ia berobat ke dokter. Dokter akan mengevaluasi, mendiagnosis, dan membuat perencanaan, apakah anak Anda memerlukan terapi pemeliharaan jangka panjang atau cukup dengan terapi saat serangan itu muncul. Pada bronkiolitis, umumnya dapat sembuh dengan baik, sementara asma sifatnya kambuhan namun seiring pertambahan usia, gejala asma biasanya lebih jarang muncul.\r\n       Bila ada riwayat asma/alergi di keluarga Anda, maka bisa saja anak Anda memang mengalami asma. Hindarilah ia dari segala faktor pencetus munculnya serangan batuk dan mengi yang dialaminya selama ini. Berikan asupan ASI/cairan yang cukup serta makanan yang sehat.

Hal ini akan meminimalisir terjadinya efek samping obat jika obat diberikan dengan diminum atau disuntik, dimana obat akan menyebar keseluruh tubuh dan memberikan efek kebagian tubuh lain menyebabkan kemungkinan terjadinya efek samping. Justru dengan pemberian secara uap/nebulizer atau inhaler dapat meminimalisir kejadian efek samping obat.\r\n\r\nBiasanya penyakit asma hanya membutuhkan terapi pada saat serangan saja, yaitu dengan memberikan obat untuk melebarkan sarungan napas yang menyempit akibat respon peradangan. Obat-obat ini disebut golongan reliever atau pereda gejala. Tapi, pada asma yang sangat sering kambuh, atau disebut juga asma persisten dimana persisten ringan kekambuhan > 1x dalam seminggu hingga persisten berat dengan kekambuhan beberapa kali dalam sehari hingga menganggu aktifitas fisik. Pada kondisi ini biasanya dianjurkan untuk mengkonsumsi obat jangka panjang untuk mengontrol serangan asma. Golongan obat ini disebut controller atau pengontrol. Dimana obat bekerja jangka panjang untuk mencegah terjadinya serangan asma. Karena penggunaannya jangka panjang dokter lebih menganjurkan untuk diberikan secara inhalasi atau dihirup untuk mecegah efek samping sistemik/keseluruh tubuh. '),

Memang, orang dengan keturunan asma lebih berisiko untuk juga memiliki asma. Namun, ada juga keturunan asma yang tidak menderita asma. Asma merupakan salah satu jenis penyakit atopik, sama halnya dengan rhinitis alergi dan dermatitis atopik. Keturunan asma bisa juga memiliki penyakit atopik lainnya, tidak selalu asma.\r\n\r\nBila pusing, sesak napas, dan nyeri dada yang Anda alami muncul disertai juga dengan keluhan perih yang terasa di perut setiap habis makan, lebih mungkin kondisi ini terjadi akibat peningkatan asam lambung. Normalnya, lambung akan memproduksi sejumlah asam lambung untuk membantu proses pencernaan makanan. Namun, akibat beragam faktor, di antaranya jenis makanan yang dikonsumsi, tekanan psikologis, efek samping obat, dan sebagainya, bisa juga asam lambung ini diproduksi berlebihan sehingga menyebabkan lambung meradang. Peradangan ini pada akhirnya yang bisa memicu rasa nyeri dan sesak napas di area dada dan juga perut (terutama perut bagian atas). Lebih lanjut, stres yang tubuh Anda alami akibat rasa tidak nyaman ini bisa memicu diproduksinya banyak hormon stres yang berperan dalam mencetuskan rasa pusing, nyeri kepala, dan beragam keluhan lainnya. Dalam ranah medis, kondisi seperti ini kerap diistilahkan dengan gastritis.\r\n\r\nSelain gastritis dan asma, bisa juga keluhan-keluhan Anda muncul karena sebab lainnya, contohnya GERD (gastrosophageal reflux disease), kolangitis, pankreatitis, pneumonia, bronkhitis, fibromyalgia, serangan panik, gangguan cemas berlebih, dan sebagainya.\r\n\r\nAnda bisa coba dulu atasi keluhan Anda melalui beberapa langkah berikut:\r\n•	Lebih teratur memperhatikan waktu makan, makanlah setiap 3 hingga 5 jam sekali, porsi kecil hingga sedang\r\n•	Kurangi konsumsi makanan yang bisa memicu peningkatan asam lambung, contohnya makanan asam, pedas, berlemak, mengandung gas, minuman berkafein\r\n•	Hindari konsumsi makanan dan minuman yang tidak diolah dengan higienis\r\n•	Jangan makan terlalu kenyang, apalagi mendekati waktu tidur\r\n•	Tidak sembarangan mengkonsumsi obat, termasuk obat anti nyeri, anti radang, antibiotik\r\n•	Kelola stres Anda dengan bijaksana\r\n•	Tidur dengan teratur, jangan biasakan begadang\r\n•	Rutin berolahraga\r\n•	Jalani pola hidup sehat, jangan merokok apalagi mengkonsumsi alkohol\r\n\r\nJika langkah-langkah di atas masih belum berhasil mengatasi keluhan Anda, sebaiknya Anda kunjungi langsung dokter atau dokter spesialis penyakit dalam di fasilitas kesehatan terdekat ya..

Apakah obat tersebut Anda peroleh dengan resep dokter? Lantas, apakah dokter memang menganjurkan pada Anda untuk selalu menggunakan obat tersebut saat asma Anda kambuh?\r\n\r\nAsma bronkhiale, atau lebih umum disebut dengan asma, merupakan suatu peradangan kronis pada saluran pernapasan bagian bawah yang menyebabkan penderitanya mengalami sesak napas, bunyi napas tambahan (mengi), dan juga batuk-batuk. Gejala-gejala ini muncul karena jalan napas yang mengalami penyempitan dan juga lendir saluran napas yang diproduksi berlebihan. Asma merupakan penyakit kambuhan. Kekambuhan penyakit ini bisa dicetuskan oleh banyak faktor, seringnya faktor lingkungan (seperti cuaca dingin, berdebu, berasap, banyak mengandung serbuk sari), faktor psikis (seperti saat sedang merasa stres, cemas, panik, atau takut), faktor fisik (seperti saat sedang mengalami kelelahan, sedang berolahraga), infeksi saluran pernapasan, refluks (aliran balik) asam lambung, hingga pengaruh konsumsi beberapa jenis obat (contohnya beta bloker, aspirin, ibuprofen).\r\n\r\nKarena produksi lendir saluran napas yang meningkat inilah penderita asma seringkali mengalami batuk disertai keluarnya lendir menyerupai jelly sebagaimana yang Anda alami. Kondisi ini perlu mendapat penanganan yang tepat supaya tidak membatasi penderitanya dalam beraktifitas. Bila benar Anda sudah pernah memeriksakan diri ke dokter dan didiagnosis asma, maka dokter biasanya akan memberikan Anda 2 jenis penanganan utama, yakni penanganan saat timbul serangan asma, dan penanganan untuk mengontrol supaya serangan asma tidak terjadi berulang. Obat yang Anda sebutkan tersebut merupakan bagian dari penanganan ini. Bila obat tersebut Anda gunakan berulang atas saran langsung dari dokter yang memeriksa Anda, semestinya kondisi ini tidak berbahaya. Namun, bila dokter Anda tidak menyarankan langsung tindakan tersebut, sebaiknya Anda tidak melakukannya sembarangan.\r\n\r\nAsma hingga kini bukan merupakan suatu penyakit yang bisa disembuhkan secara total. Namun, penderita asma bisa tetap beraktifitas sebagaimana orang normal tanpa kendala yang berarti bila ia mampu mengelola pencetus asmanya dengan baik. Karenanya, langkah terbaik yang perlu dilakukan adalah pencegahan agar serangan asma tidak selalu kambuh dan berulang. Beberapa upaya yang bisa Anda lakukan di antaranya:\r\n•	Kenali, hal-hal apa saja yang biasanya memicu serangan asma Anda, lalu sebisa mungkin hindari pemicu tersebut\r\n•	Jalani imunisasi agar terlindung dari infeksi saluran pernapasan yang sering terjadi, contohnya influenza dan pneumonia\r\n•	Rajin melakukan latihan pernapasan\r\n•	Rutin berolahraga 1-2 hari sekali\r\n•	Kelola stres dengan bijaksana\r\n•	Jalani pola makan yang sehat, teratur, hindari makanan yang rentan membuat Anda alergi\r\n•	Bila serangan asma kambuh, periksakan diri langsung ke dokter atau dokter penyakit dalam agar diberikan penanganan yang tepat\r\nSemoga membantu.

Beberapa hal berikut dapat memicu serangan asma yaitu asap rokok, debu, bulu hewan, aktivitas fisik, udara dingin, atau infeksi. Peradangan ini diperparah dengan produksi lendir saluran pernapasan yang meningkat sehingga saluran pernapasan bertambah sempit dan menimbulkan gejala sesak napas. Selain sesak napas, penderitanya juga dapat mengalami gejala batuk, sakit dada, dan mengi.\r\n\r\nPernapasan terdiri dari dua fase yaitu fase inspirasi (menghirup udara) dan fase ekspirasi (menghembuskan udara). Pada proses pernapasan yang normal, fase ekspirasi merupakan gerakan pasif yang tidak memerlukan gerakan otot pernapasan. Pada penderita asma, saluran pernapasan yang menyempit menyebabkan udara terperangkap di dalam kantung udara sehingga proses pengeluaran udara pernapasan berlangsung lebih lama, atau dengan kata lain, fase ekspirasi menjadi memanjang.\r\n\r\nUntuk mengatasi penyakit ini hal yang terpenting adalah dengan menghindari pemicunya.

(70, 'Hallo dok, saya Devita kebetulan saya penderita asma, apakah asma bisa menjalar kekulit? kalau ya apakah tanda-tandanya?  ', 'Asma merupakan penyakit yang ditandai dengan penyempitan saluran napas akibat mekanisme alergi pada orang tertentu. Mekanisme alergi ini dapat dipicu oleh makanan, udara dingin, aktivitas fisik misalnya olahraga, menghirup sesuatu seperti debu, bulu hewan, atau serbuk bunga, dsb. Mekanisme yang terjadi akibat hal-hal tersebut akan menyebabkan kontraksi otot pernapasan dan pengeluaran sel-sel radang sehingga jalan napas mengecil dan mengakibatkan seseorang sesak napas. Sesak pada asma biasanya diikuti dengan suara mengi. Umumnya asma merupakan bawaan genetik dan dapat diturunkan dari keluarga. \r\n\r\nSeseorang yang menderita asma, biasanya dirinya cenderung pula untuk mengembangkan penyakit alergi pada bagian tubuh lainnya, seperti alergi pada hidung (rhinitis alergi), alergi pada mata (konjunctivitis alergi) alergi pada kulit (dermatitis atopi/eksim). Kelompok penyakit-penyakit ini bersama dengan asma disebut sebagai penyakit atopi (atopic disease). \r\n\r\nBila pemicunya sama, tak jarang gejala-gejala alergi pada tubuh ini muncul secara bersamaan. \r\n\r\nMengenai pertanyaan Anda, sebelumnya, apakah \"keluhan asma yang menjalar hingga kulit\" maksudnya adalah keluhan kulit yang muncul berbarengan dengan asma? Bila demikian, hal itu kemungkinan merupakan dermatitis atopi/eksim bawaan, yang cenderung terjadi pula pada pasien dengan asma. Selain dermatitis atopi, keluhan kulit yang juga dipicu oleh alergi adalah urtikaria, yaitu kemerahan menonjol pada kulit yang terasa gatal.\r\n\r\nNamun demikian, dapat pula keluhan kulit tersebut tidak berhubungan dengan kondisi asma atau alergi, melainkan disebabkan oleh infeksi kuman (bakteri, jamur, kutu, virus), riwayat kontak dengan bahan yang mengiritasi kulit, mekanisme alergi kontak pada kulit, gigitan hewan, dsb. \r\n\r\nUntuk itu, sebaiknya Anda periksakan terlebih dahulu ke dokter umum supaya dapat diperiksa langsung dan dipastikan penyebab keluhan kulit Anda. Bila perlu dokter akan merujuk Anda ke dokter kulit untuk pelacakan dan penanganan lanjutan. \r\n\r\nSementara itu, hal-hal yang harus Anda lakukan untuk memperbaiki kondisi dan mencegah perburukan pada asma adalah:\r\n\r\nHindari pemicu asma dan alergi lainnya bila sudah diketahui\r\nGunakan obat asma secara rutin (bila ada) dan saat serangan\r\nOlahraga teratur sekitar 3-4 kali seminggu, terutama yang berjenis aerobik ringan. Jangan terlalu berlebihan dalam olahraga karena dikhawatirkan akan mencetuskan asma\r\nAtasi stress dengan baik\r\nUntuk menjaga kesehatan kulit, yang perlu Anda lakukan:\r\n\r\n•	Mandi minimal 2x sehari\r\n•	Keringkan tubuh setelah mandi atau setelah berkeringat\r\n•	Gunakan pakaian tipis, lembut, dan menyerap keringat\r\n•	Lakukan tes tempel (patch test) terlebih dahulu setiap akan memakai produk baru yang dioleskan di kulit. Caranya, dengan mengoleskan produk tersebut ke sedikit bagian kulit lalu amati sekitar sehari setelahnya apakah muncul kemerahan, gatal, atau perih. Bila terdapat hal demikian, artinya Anda alergi terhadap bahan di dalam produk oles tersebut\r\n•	Gunakan pelembab tubuh untuk menghindari kekeringan pada kulit Anda\r\n•	Gunakan tabir surya saat akan terpapar matahari\r\n\r\nSekian penjelasan dari saya, semoga membantu dan bermanfaat :)'),

Sehingga jika Anda memang memiliki riwayat penyakit asam lambung, maka bisa jadi itu penyebabnya.\r\n\r\nNamun seperti yang Anda bisa lihat, ada banyak kemungkinan lainnya. Maka dari itu, langkah terbaik untuk Anda lakukan sekarang adalah memeriksakan diri Anda ke dokter umum terlebih dahulu untuk dipastikan kemungkinannya melalui serangkaian penggalian riwayat, pemeriksaan fisik serta penunjang. Dengan demikian, kecenderungannya bisa lebih terlihat dan penanganannya pun bisa lebih tepat.\r\n\r\nSementara itu, perbanyak konsumsi air putih hangat, oleskan balsam hangat pada perut dan dada, hindari makanan pedas, asam dan berminyak, hindari kopi dan rokok, boleh konsumsi obat maag yang dijual bebas dengan membaca aturan pakai yang tertera, dan segera periksakan ke dokter, terutama jika gejalanya memburuk. Sekian, semoga menjawab pertanyaan Anda.'),
(91, 'Saya kan sedang hamil 12 minggu jadi saya memang mempunyai asma sejak dulu tapi semenjak 6 bulan ini tidak pernah kambuh tapi tiba-tiba pagi ini kambuh dan karena sudah tidak tahan lagi saya menggunakan inhaler yang semprot itu 2 kali.\r\napakah berbahaya bagi janin saya?\r\njika berbahaya apa yang harus saya lakukan mengatasi jika asma saya tiba-tiba kambuh dok? dan apakah saya bisa melahirkan normal dikemudian hari dok?', 'Asma pada ibu hamil dapat menimbulkan rasa khawatir pada ibu. Yang perlu diketahui bahwa ketika terjadi serangan asma maka dapat mengganggu asupan oksigen ke janin. Maka baiknya jika anda memiliki asma dan sedang hamil maka hindari pencetus asma. Pencetusnya dapat berupa asap rokok, debu, udara dingin, makanan dan minuman yang dapat memicu timbulnya keluhan, serta hindari stres psikis. \r\n\r\nJika anda memiliki asma maka pastikan bahwa dokter kandungan anda mengetahui keadaan anda sehingga dapat disarankan obat2an apa saja yang aman untuk janin. Walaupun pada umumnya obat asma aman untuk kehamilan. Obat asma lebih baik digunakan oleh ibu hamil jika manfaatnya lebih besar daripada efek sampingnya.\r\n\r\nJika selama kehamilan sering sekali mengalami serangan asma maka efek bagi kehamilan diantaranya:\r\n\r\n•	sulit dalam persalinan\r\n•	peningkatan tekanan darah selama kehamilan\r\n•	kelahiran prematur\r\n•	pertumbuhan janin terganggu\r\n•	berat badan bayi rendah\r\n\r\nMelihat efek samping yang ada, maka hindari pencetus asma dan rutinlah memeriksakan kehamilan, makan makanan yang bergizi, dan rutin mengecek pergerakan janin.\r\n\r\nbaca juga: asma ketika hamil\r\n\r\nSemoga bermanfaat '),
(92, 'Saya penderita asma sejak bayi namun saat menginjak usia remaja hingga umur 19 tahun asma saya tidak pernah kambuh. Namun akhir-akhir ini pada saat usia saya 20 tahun asma saya tiba-tiba kambuh dan membuat saya tidak bisa tidur dengan pulas dan hanya sekitar 2 jam tertidur. Kira-kira posisi tidur bagaimana yang nyaman bagi penderita asma?', 'Penyakit asma merupakan penyakit yang dapat diturunkan menandakan tubuh mempunyai kerentanan genetik yakni alergi, penyakit asma ditandai dengan penyempitan saluran nafas paru sehingga menyebabkan sulit bernafas, batuk-batuk dapat kering atau berdahak. Kekambuhan asma biasanya dipicu oleh sesuatu dapat udara dingin, udara kotor seperti debu, asap, AC kotor hingga makanan atau sedang terinfeksi penyakit paru lain seperti Faringitis atau Bronkitis.\r\n\r\nBila Asma yang sedang diderita kambuh sebaiknya memeriksakan diri ke dokter, dokter akan melakukan pemeriksan fisik paru, rontgen paru, pemeriksana darah dan pemeriksana spirometri bila perlu. Pengobatan pada penderita asma dapat menggunakan antihistamin, bronkodilator baik tablet atau hisap paru, mukolitik atau pengencer dahak, hingga antibiotik bila diperlukan. Pengobatan yang tepat dan cepat akan membantu penyembuhan, mencegah komplikasi dan mencegah kekambuhan. Dokter dapat memberikan pengobatan inhalasi atau hirup yang dapat digunakan sebagai pertolongan pertama saat mulai dirasakan sesak. Atau bila kekambuhan hampir setiap hari maka dokter akan memberikan pengobatan rutin secara hisap paru (inhalasi kontroler).\r\n\r\nYang dapat disarankan untuk cegah kekambuhan adalah paling utama menghindari kontak dengan pencetus kekambuhan, seperti hindari udara dingin malam, hindari mandi malam atau pagi dengan air dingin melainkan gunakan air hangat . Guankan masker bila berpergian untuk menghindair polusi dan cegah penularan virus dari penderita lain. Stop merokok atau berada dilingkungan merokok. Bersihkan ventilasi rumah, kipas atau AC rutin. Hindari makanan pencetus alergi bila ada seperti kacang-kacangan atau seafood. Posisi yang nyaman saat kambuh adalah setengah duduk dengan kemiringan 30-60 derajat. Namun penting untuk segera mengatasi sesak bila sedang kambuh seperti konsumsi obat atau mendapat terapi nebulasi obat bronkodilator di IGD terdekat. Bila tidak teratasi dengan pengobatan maka tidur akan sulit untuk nyenyak.  '),
(93, 'Saya penderita sesak asma, saya sempat ke Dokter, dan diberikan obat inhaler (dosis 160). Dan saya sudah menggunakan selama hampir 3 tahun, dan benar-benar lega & jarang kambuh, 1 botol 120 hirup bisa untuk 1 tahun. Apakah saya salah karena tidak pernah kontrol lagi ke Dokter & bila inhaler habis saya beli sendiri ke toko online.  ', 'Dalam mengatasi gejala Asma, dokter akan meresepkan obat asma sesuai dengan kebutuhan dan kondisi pasien. Obat asma ada yang berupa tablet minum maupun inhaler yang dapat dihirup. \r\n\r\nObat inhaler yang tersedia memiliki banyak jenis, misalnya obat anti radang (kortikosteroid), atau teofilin untuk merelakskan otot-otot pernapasan. Intinya obat inhaler ada yang bertugas sebagai pereda dan pencegah.\r\n\r\nMeski sebagian besar obat inhaler ditujukan untuk penggunaan jangka panjang, namun anda sebaiknya tidak membeli obat tersebut tanpa menggunakan resep dokter. Setidaknya penderita disarankan untuk melakukan kontrol paling lama satahun sekali. Dokter akan mengevaluasi kondisi terkini anda, apakah perlu diturunkan dosisnya atau bahkan perlu mengganti jenis obat karena kondisi anda saat ini mungkin memiliki kontraindikasi untuk menggunakan obat inhaler yang sebelumnya anda gunakan.\r\n\r\nPenggunaan jangka panjang tanpa pengawasan dokter juga beresiko tinggi terjadinya efek samping seperti kram otot, sakit kepala, infeksi jamur pada mulut, batuk-batuk, hingga irama jantung tidak teratur.\r\n\r\nSelain menggunakan obat-obatan, penderita asam juga dihimbau untuk mengkonsumsi makanan sehat dan bergizi seimbang, menghindari pencetus asma, dan melakukan olah raga secara rutin.'),
(94, 'Usia 40 tahun saya asma sejak usia 15 tahun sudah 25 tahun. selama ini sesaknya kalau malam saja. namun setahun ini setelah saya melahirkan anak. Setiap hari sesak baik siang maupun malam. saya menggunakan obat semprot dan hirup. saya ingin mengurangi / tidak mau tergantung obat bagaimana caranya? apakah saya boleh hamil lagi?', 'Asma merupakan penyakit peradangan dan penyempitan saluran nafas yang timbul karena adanya faktor pencetus yaitu allergen. Asma bersifat kronis (jangka panjang), tidak dapat disembuhkan, namun bisa dikontrol gejalanya. Yang terpenting dari pengobatan asma adalah:\r\n\r\n1.     Menghindari faktor pencetusnya. Cari hal-hal yang biasa membuat Anda sesak lalu hindarilah hal-hal tersebut. Jika perlu, Anda bisa ke rumah sakit dan meminta pemeriksaan alergi agar Anda tau Anda alergi pada hal apa saja, sehingga Anda dapat menghindarinya.\r\n\r\n2.     Minum dan konsumsi obat secara teratur dari dokter.\r\n\r\n3.     Kontrol pada dokter secara teratur untuk melihat respon Anda terhadap obat yang diberikan, melihat perkembangan kondisi Anda, dan menyesuaikan dosis yang Anda perlukan. Dokter dapat mempertimbangkan pengubahan dosis sesuai dengan kemajuan kondisi Anda. Jika menurut pemeriksaan kondisi Anda makin lama makin baik, dokter bisa secara bertahap mengurangi hingga menghentikan pengobatan pengontrol.\r\n\r\nAnda dapat mengonsultasikan hal ini pada dokter spesialis paru. Jika ingin hamil lagi, konsultasikan hal ini pada spesialis kandungan juga. Karena, usia 40 tahun merupakan salah 1 risiko tinggi kehamilan terlebih Anda memiliki riwayat asma. Kehamilan risiko tinggi adalah kondisi dimana kehamilan dapat mengancam kesehatan dan keselamatan ibu dan janin. Contoh kehamilan risiko tinggi adalah:\r\n\r\n1.     Usia terlalu muda (di bawah 18 tahun) atau terlalu tua (di atas 35 tahun)\r\n\r\n2.     Kehamilan kelima atau lebih\r\n\r\n3.     Jarak antar kehamilan di bawah 2 tahun dan di atas 5 tahun\r\n\r\n4.

(95, 'Hallo dok mau tanya . Cara mengatasi badan gemetar setelah mengkonsumsi salbutamol ?    ', 'Salbutamol merupakan obat golongan bronkhodilator, yang bekerja melemaskan otot halus di dinding saluran pernapasan yang menyempit agar diameternya membesar, sehingga udara pun bisa lebih lancar mengalir ke paru-paru. Salbutamol kerap digunakan untuk meredakan gejala sesak, misalnya akibat serangan asma atau PPOK (penyakit parut obstruktif kronis).\r\n\r\nUntuk menjalankan efeknya, salbutamol bekerja di reseptor beta adrenergik. Reseptor ini terdapat di hampir seluruh bagian tubuh, terutama di dinding lapisan otot polos saluran pernapasan dan kardiovaskuler. Akibatnya, meski kerja utamanya adalah pada otot polos di saluran pernapasan, obat ini bisa berefek juga pada otot polos yang ada di saluran kardiovaskuler, yakni jantung dan pembuluh darah. Karena inilah, orang yang mengkonsumsi salbutamol kerap mengalami efek samping berupa jantung yang berdebar-debar, tubuh gemetar, nyeri kepala, tremor, insomnia, mual, muntah, dan sebagainya.\r\n\r\nBila keluhan yang Anda rasakan bersifat ringan saja, umumnya kondisi ini tidak berbahaya dan akan membaik dengan sendirinya dengan istirahat dan pola hidup yang sehat. Akan tetapi, apabila gemetar yang Anda rasakan teramat hebat, hingga menyebabkan keterbatasan bagi Anda dalam beraktifitas sehari-hari, maka Anda sebaiknya memeriksakan diri langsung ke dokter. Dengan evaluasi secara langsung, dokter bisa menentukan penanganan seperti apa yang tepat untuk dilakukan, misalnya dengan pemberian obat tambahan, atau juga memberikan Anda alternatif terapi lain untuk mengatasi sesak napas selain salbutamol.\r\n\r\nSaat ini, Anda sebaiknya perbanyak beristirahat, makan dan minum secara teratur agar tubuh tidak gemetar. Disiplin juga dalam menerapkan waktu tidur, hindari konsumsi kafein berlebihan, serta jauhi rokok, alkohol, dan juga obat terlarang.\r\n\r\nSemoga membantu ya..'),
(96, 'Saya punya masalah dok, dibagian belakang, tulang terasa ngilu, gatal dibagian kaki dan tangan, dan juga pernapasan terasa sesak, sering pusing. Kira-kira itu penyakit apa ya dok? Dan bagaimana cara mengatasinya !!!   ', 'Pada dasarnya gejala yang Anda kemukakan bisa saja tidak berkaitan satu sama lain. Nyeri pada bagian belakang yang disertai ngilu-ngilu pada tulang bisa disebabkan oleh peradangan sendi, cidera pada tulang, hingga kram pada otot punggung, misalnya oleh karena kesalahan postur dalam jangka waktu lama. Pada kasus yang tidak terlalu sering, saraf kejepit juga bisa menyebabkan sakit punggung. Sementara rasa gatal pada kaki tangan, bisa disebabkan oleh peradangan kulit akibat paparan produk yang iritan atau reaksi alergi akibat makanan/minuman/obat-obatan tertentu. Selain itu infeksi pada kulit yang bisa disebabkan oleh bakteri, virus, maupun jamur juga perlu dipikirkan, disamping kemungkinan gigitan serangga. Untuk pernapasan yang sesak bisa disebabkan oleh masalah pada sistem pernapasan seperti asma, proses alergi, maupun infeksi saluran napas, atau masalah di luar sistem pernapasan seperti asam lambung hingga gejala psikis seperti cemas, begitu pula dengan pusing yang bisa menyertai beberapa penyakit.\r\n\r\nOleh karena gejala yang cenderung kompleks dan bisa tidak memiliki kaitan satu sama lain, maka tentunya diperlukan pemeriksaan fisik secara langsung oleh dokter diikuti dengan penunjang bila memang diperlukan. Hal ini tentunya juga dibarengi perubahan gaya hidup seperti menghindari makanan pemicu asam lambung seperti makanan pedas, bersantan, dan minuman berkafein. Penuhi kecukupan istirahat dan konsumsi cairan 2-3 liter per hari. Berikut kami lampirkan artikel mengenai sesak. Semoga bermanfaat.'),
(97, 'Halo dok, saya ingin bertanya dari segi kedokteran apakah terapi gurah untuk menyembuhkan asma aman untuk dilakukan? Apakah efek samping dari terapi gurah? Terimakasih dok.  ', 'Terapi gurah merupakan terapi tradisional yang bertujuan untuk mengeluarkan lendir dari dalam tubuh. Selama ini gurah dipercaya dapat menyembuhkan penyakit sinusitis. Sayangnya belum banyak penelitian tentang terapi gurah untuk bisa mengetahui keefektifitasannya. Bila Anda ingin tahu lebih lanjut mengenai gurah, klik link berikut menuju artikel kami tentang Gurah.\r\n\r\nLalu mengenai pertanyaan Anda tentang gurah dan asma, meskipun pada asma juga bisa terdapat lendir, ada perbedaan antara penyakit asma dan penyakit sinusitis. Asma merupakan penyakit yang berasal dari respon berlebihan tubuh terhadap debu, udara dingin, makanan yang menyebabkan alergi, kelelahan, stress, yang mana respon berlebihan ini salah satunya paling jelas muncul dalam bentuk sesak napas. Meski seseorang diberikan penanganan asma, bila pada suatu saat nanti pemicunya muncul, maka asma nya bisa muncul kembali, karena ini hubungannya dengan daya tahan tubuh yang akan selalu ada selama hidup.\r\n\r\nSehingga menangani asma dengan menggunakan metode gurah tidak akan terlalu bermanfaat, karena kondisi ini bisa kumat kembali suatu saat nanti bila pemicunya kembali.\r\n\r\nSekian, semoga bermanfaat.'),
(98, 'saya punya keluhan batuk yang disertai napas sesak dan berbunyi, ini terjadi biasanya ketika saya sedang tidur khusunya menjelang pagi. bagaimana cara mengobatinya?', 'Batuk merupakan suatu mekanisme pertahanan tubuh, bila ada masalah disaluran pernafasan, bila batuk disertai suara tambahan kemungkinan ada sumbatan atau halangan pada saluran nafas, yang umumnya disebabkan oleh lendir/dahak yang kental, amandel yang berukuran besar, atau adanya masa pada saluran nafas. Dan Batuk yang disertai nafas sesak dan berbunyi, kemungkinan penyebabny adalah:\r\n\r\nAsma bronkhiale\r\nTonsilofaringitis\r\nBronkhitis\r\nPneumonia\r\nBatuk rejan\r\nPPOK/ penyakit paru obstruktif kronik\r\nJika batuk semakin parah dan semakin sesak  segera periksakan ke dokter, agar dokter bisa memeriksa Anda secara langsung, melakukan pemeriksaan penunjang seperti pemeriksaan darah dan pemeriksaan rontgen dada. \r\n\r\nYang bisa Anda lakukan dirumah, untuk mengurangi gejala batuk dan sesak adalah:\r\n\r\nBanyak minum air putih hangat\r\nOleskan minyak hangat di dada atau tenggorokan\r\nHindari asap rokok\r\nGunakan masker bila berada ditempat umum\r\nHindari faktor alergen\r\nHirup air hangat yang diteteskan minyak hangat, agar pernafasan lega.\r\nHindari makanan yang berlemak, atau makanan yang mengiritasi tenggorokan  '),
(99, 'Saya sekarang sedang menyusui anak saya yang berumur baru 1 minggu. Sekarang asma saya kambuh, apakah bisa saya minum obat salbutamol atau itu akan mengganggu bayi saya?', 'Asma bronkhiale (asma) terjadi akibat peradangan kronis di saluran napas bagian bawah, tepatnya bronkhus. Kondisi ini disebabkan oleh reaksi hipersensitifitas, yang kerap dipicu oleh faktor genetik (bawaan), perubahan cuaca, kelelahan, pajanan alergen tertentu, infeksi saluran napas, stres, atau juga efek samping obat tertentu.\r\n\r\nSerangan asma bisa terasa sangat mengganggu penderitanya. Biasanya, gejala yang muncul adalah berupa sesak napas, batuk-batuk, disertai bunyi napas yang mengganggu, yakni mengi (ngik-ngik). Pada kondisi yang cukup berat, penderita bisa mengalami kesulitan untuk tidur akibat sesak napas tersebut. Hal ini tentu bisa menganggu proses menyusui dan bisa mempengaruhi produksi ASI.\r\n\r\nMengatasi asma saat menyusui tidak boleh dilakukan sembarangan. Hal ini dikarenakan, sedikit atau banyak obat asma yang Anda konsumsi akan disekresikan juga dalam ASI yang dikonsumsi bayi Anda. Termasuk juga salbutamol. Dalam kaitannya dengan keamanannya saat digunakan oleh ibu hamil dan menyusui, obat ini termasuk dalam kategori C, yakni tampak adanya efek samping pada janin di percobaan yang dilakukan pada binatang, namun belum ada studi terkontrol yang dilakukan pada manusia. Banyak ahli lebih merekomendasikan penggunaan salbutamol inhaler karena konsentrasinya yang lebih sedikit dijumpai pada ASI dibandingkan dengan sambutamol oral. Akan tetapi, kembali lagi, penggunaan salbutamol bagi ibu menyusui sebaiknya HANYA dilakukan di bawah resep dan pengawasan dokter. Bila memang dokter merasa manfaat yang dihasilkan lebih banyak dari efek samping yang mungkin ditimbulkan, maka pemberian obat mungkin bisa dilakukan. Namun bila tidak, maka alternatif terapi lain bisa dipertimbangkan. Oleh karenanya, periksakan langsung diri Anda ke dokter agar mendapatkan penanganan terbaik ya..\r\n\r\nSaat ini, Anda bisa redakan serangan asma Anda dengan cara berikut:\r\n\r\n•	Tenangkan diri Anda, jangan cemas atau panik\r\n•	Duduk tegak sedikit bersandar, sambil atur napas secara perlahan, yakni dengan menarik napas 2 detik melalui hidung, lalu hembuskan 3 detik melalui mulut, lakukan berulang\r\n•	Pindah ke ruangan yang nyaman, tidak terlalu banyak orang, tidak bising, dan bersirkulasi udara baik\r\n•	Kenali pencetus asma Anda, dan hindari pencetus tersebut\r\n•	Jauhi rokok dan asapnya\r\n\r\nSemoga membantu ya..

(100, 'Sering sesak napas kalau saya banyak pikiran tapi saya tidak punya penyakit darah tinggi. setiap ada masalah dan selalu terpikirkan pasti sesak. Tetapi saya di ronsen paru saya normal. hanya hilus. jadi lendir paru berlebihan kenapa?', 'Kondisi sesak napas yang Anda alami paling sering disebabkan oleh karena asma, dimana asma merupakan penyakit kronis yang disebabkan oleh karena peradangan di dalam saluran pernapasan.\r\n\r\nPeradangan ini membuat saluran pernapasan membengkak dan sangat sensitif, sehingga saluran pernapasan menyempit, menyebabkan kurangnya udara yang mengalir ke paru - paru.\r\n\r\nGejala - gejala asma sendiri diantaranya adalah: batuk (berdahak), mengi suara siulan melengking yang muncul ketika bernapas, dada sesak, dada terasa terkesan, sulit tidur, dll.\r\n\r\nPemicu yang dapat menyebabkan timbulnya asma diantaranya adalah: stress psikologis, alergen, paparan polusi, infeksi paru - paru, aktivitas fisik=== olahraga, makanan dan minuman tertentu, dsb.\r\n\r\nSelain dari asma, sesak napas juga dapat disebabkan oleh karena: pilek, alergi, anemia, sinusitis, tuberkulosis / TBC, tekanan darah rendah, pneumonia, kanker paru - paru, penyakit paru obstruktif kronik, gangguan pada jantung, dll.\r\n\r\nCobalah diskusikan masalah ini dengan Dokter Spesialis Penyakit paru agar Anda dapat dilakukan serangkaian pemeriksaan lebih lanjut, sehingga penyebab pasti dari keadaan ini diketahui dan akhirnya penanganan yang tepat dapat diberikan.
